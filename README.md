# Unity Projects

> ### Flappy block

Flappy bird based game. My first Unity project.

U can move to left and right tho (cuz why not)

> ### Rampage

Roguelike game (almost). Heavily rng based. Kill monsters with guns and upgrade your stats.

Main goal - survive 100 waves of monsters (rly hard)

> ### Sweeper

Minesweeper game. Nothing special. _(I love minesweeper)_

U can change: board size, tile size, mines percentage
